### To create models usuable on the webapp:

Use the tensorflowjs_converter found here: https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/tree/master/tfjs-converter

When using the wizard use the default selections. Your model should be turend into multiple .bin files a singular .json file.
This is now a tensorflow.js model and can be loaded by the webpage.

If your model comes out as only a singular .bin file there might be an issue, try some of the other options in the conversation tool.
The defaults are automatically selected based on the tools detection but can detect wrong.
